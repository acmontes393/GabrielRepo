#Repository for Assignment 1

##Description of the Assignment
"The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics". 
Tasks:

1. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. 

2. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. 

3. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. 

4. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. 

##Our analysis
We looked at two datasets: swiss and mtcars. 
* Swiss contains sociodemographic data of Swiss cantons from 1888. Our analysis focuses on the relationship between faith (Catholic or Protestant) and fertility
* Mtcars has data about the characteristics of certain car models. We looked at the relationship between the transmission type of cars (Manual or Automatic) and their fuel efficiency.

In both analyses, we look at the distribution of our relevant variables and perform some transformations (e.g. we combine existing variables to create new ones).

##Presentation of results

We created two presentation with the results of our analysis:
